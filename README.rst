Carve Windows Prefetch artifacts from arbitrary binary data
Windows-Prefetch-Carver
========================    
Python script to carve Windows Prefetch artifacts from arbitrary binary data

Description
-------------
The Windows application prefetch mechanism is in place to offer performance benefits when launching applications. It's also one of the more beneficial forensic artifacts regarding evidence of applicaiton execution. prefetch-carve.py provides functionality for carving prefetch artifacts from binary data - such as unallocated disk space, raw memory images, etc. prefetch-carve.py will output to the specified file, and supports multiple output formats.

Supported Prefetch Types
--------------------------
Windows 10 Prefetch files are compressed, and therefore unabled to be carved from disk. All other Prefetch formats are supported (Windows XP - Windows 8.1)
